Scorsese, fresh from a rapturous reception for his Killers of the Flower Moon at the Cannes film festival, is currently in Italy attending a series of religious and cinematic events.

Speaking at a conference at the Vatican on Saturday, Scorsese, 80, said: “I have responded to the Pope’s appeal to artists in the only way I know how: by imagining and writing a screenplay for a film about Jesus.”
